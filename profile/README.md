## 🎯 Rainbow Six Siege Aimbot – Lock On, Eliminate, Repeat

## 🕹️ Why Use an Aimbot in R6?

*Rainbow Six Siege* is a no-lag, no-luck tactical shooter. If you’re not fast—you're fragged. A legit aimbot helps you snap to the head, clutch 1v5s, and hold sites like a wall. All while looking smooth. 😎🔫
